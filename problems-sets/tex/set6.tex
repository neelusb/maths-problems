\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Consider a set of lattice points. For what n can a regular convex n-gon sit atop the lattice points s.t each vertex of the shape lives on a lattice point.
	
	\item
	Find the general solution to the following differential equations,\\
	$\frac{d^{3}y}{dx^{3}} - 3\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} + 4y = 0$,\\
	$\frac{d^{4}y}{dx^{4}} + 4\frac{d^{3}y}{dx^{3}} + 6\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} + 4\frac{dy}{dx} + y = 0$
	
	\item
	Evaluate the following integrals,\\
	$\int \sin^{n}(x) dx$ and $\int \cos^{n}(x) dx$
	
    \item
    Let G be a convex quadrilateral. Show that there is a point X in the plane of G with the property that every straight line through X divides G into two regions of equal area if and only if G is a parallelogram.
    
    \item
    Andrew, Bruce, Chloie, and David are sitting in a circle playing a passing game where on any given turn the player with the parcel passes the parcel to the left $25\%$ of the time, to the left $25\%$ of the time, and they hold onto it $50\%$ of the time. Given that Andrew starts with the parcel, find the probability for each player that they have the parcel on the n-th turn.
    
    \item
    You have a tetrahedron with side lengths $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$. What is the volume of a tetrahedron. Can all polyhedron be constructed from tetrahedron?
    
    \item
    Prove that for any polyhedron with $E$ edges, $F$ faces and $V$ vertices, $V - E + F = 2$.
    
    \item
    Two particles X and Y, of equal mass $m$, lie on a smooth horizontal table and are connected by a light elastic spring of natural length $a$ and modulus of elasticity $\lambda$. Two more springs, identical to the first, connect X to a point P on the table and Y to a point Q on the table. The distance between P and Q is 3a. Initially, the particles are held so that $XP = $, $YQ = $, and $PXYQ$ is a straight line. The particles are then released.
    
    Find the positions of particles X and Y in terms of the time since their release.
    
    \item
    There are 100 ants on a 99 meter long rod, they are distributed on the rod s.t there is a distance of 1 meter between each ant and each ant is facing towards the center of the rod. The ants move with a constant speed of 1 metre every 10 seconds and they change direction upon collision with one another. How long till all the ants have fallen off the rod and how many collisions will there have been?
    
    \item
    What is the maximum possible area of a triangle whose perimeter has length $p$?
    
    \item
    --- the gnome has been summoned to the kingdom of --- in order to design an algorithm for appointing a new ruler from every voters list of preferences. At the time of their arrival the votes have already been collected (a vote constitutes a list of preferences for the candidates), and the ruling council has determined a set of criteria that the voting system must satisfy.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If every voter prefers candidate X over candidate Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
        \item If every voters preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will remain unchanged.
        \item No single voter possesses the power to always determine the group's preference.
    \end{enumerate}
    Given that there are 100 voters, does there exist a voting system that satisfies the above conditions?
