    If you take a rubik's cube and repeatedly apply any sequence of moves to it. Will the cube eventually return to it's initial condition

	\item
	A function $f(x)$ is defined as follows. $f''(x) = -f(x)$, $f(0) = 0$ and $f'(0) = 1$. Prove that:
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item $f(x + a) = f(x)f'(a) + f'(x)f(a)$
	    \item $(f(x))^2 + (f'(x))^2 = 1$
	    \item $\exists x$ $f(x+a) = f'(x)$
	\end{enumerate}
	You may use without proof that fact that any linear second order differential equation with initial conditions has a unique solution

	\item
	You are given a normal die and a blank die.

	How can you label the blank die using the numbers 0 to 6 so that when you roll the two dice the sum shows each whole number from 1 to 12 with equal chance

	% Seesaw problem
	\item

	\item
	Evaluate
	$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\sin^3{x}}{2 + \sin(x)} dx$

	\item
	For what $\theta$ such that $0 \leq \theta \geq 2\pi$ is $\sin(x) + \cos(x) \geq 0$

	\item
	Show that a real number has a repeating decimal expansion \iff that number is rational

	\item
	Find the general solution for the system of diffrential equations.
	$\frac{dy}{dt} = -2(y-z)$ and $\frac{dz}{dt} = -\frac{dy}{dt} - 3z$

	\item
	Five children (Ammar, Bilal, Chris, Dan and Egan) raced each other.  First they raced to the spreading chestnut tree, and then they raced back to their starting point. The following facts are known:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Ammar was fourth in the race to the tree.
		\item The person who was last to the tree managed to win the race back.
		\item The person who won the race to the tree was third on the way back.
		\item The person who was third in the race to the tree was second on the way back.
		\item Bilal was fourth on the way back.
		\item Chris reached the tree before Dan.
		\item Chris got back to the start before Egan.
	\end{enumerate}
	For  each  race  (to  the  tree  and  back  again),  write  down  the  order  in  which  the  children finished.
